# Coding Task â€“ Data Feed

This is my submission for the following coding task:

````
Goal

We would like to see a command-line program that should process a local XML file (feed.xml) and push the data of that XML file to a DB of your choice (e.g., SQLite)

You are free to use any library or framework you need or feel comfortable with. You have a free choice of tools. Please use PHP!

Specifications

1. The program should be easily extendable, e.g., we could use different data storage to read data from or to push data to. This should be configurable.

2. Errors should be written to a logfile

3. The application should be tested.
