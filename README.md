# Coding Task â€“ Data Feed

This is my submission for the following coding task:

````
Goal

We would like to see a command-line program that processes a local XML file (`feed.xml`) and pushes the data of that XML file to a database of your choice (e.g., SQLite).

You are free to use any library or framework you need or feel comfortable with. You have a free choice of tools. Please use PHP!

Specifications

1. Extensibility
   - The program should be easily extendable. For example, it should be possible to use different data storage to read data from or to push data to. This should be configurable.

2. Error Logging
   - Errors should be written to a logfile.

3. Testing
   - The application should be tested.
